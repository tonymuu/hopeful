```objc
BSImagePickerViewController *imagePicker = [BSImagePickerViewController new];

// Present image picker. Any of the blocks can be nil
[self bs_presentImagePickerController:imagePicker
                             animated:YES
                               select:^(PHAsset * __nonnull asset) {
                                 // User selected an asset.
                                 // Do something with it, start upload perhaps?
                               } deselect:^(PHAsset * __nonnull asset) {
                                 // User deselected an assets.
                                 // Do something, cancel upload?
                               } cancel:^(NSArray * __nonnull assets) {
                                 // User cancelled. And this where the assets currently selected.
                               } finish:^(NSArray * __nonnull assets) {
                                 // User finished with these assets
                               } completion:nil];
```
###### Swift
```swift
let vc = BSImagePickerViewController()

bs_presentImagePickerController(vc, animated: true,
    select: { (asset: PHAsset) -> Void in
      // User selected an asset.
      // Do something with it, start upload perhaps?
    }, deselect: { (asset: PHAsset) -> Void in
      // User deselected an assets.
      // Do something, cancel upload?
    }, cancel: { (assets: [PHAsset]) -> Void in
      // User cancelled. And this where the assets currently selected.
    }, finish: { (assets: [PHAsset]) -> Void in
      // User finished with these assets
}, completion: nil)
```

## Customization

You have access to the cancel, album and done button. Customize them as you would with any other UIBarButtonItem (cancel & finish) or UIButton (album).<br />
There are also a few other settings you can tweak.They are documented in BSImagePickerSettings.<br />
